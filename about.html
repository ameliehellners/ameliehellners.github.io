        <p class="about_me">
          Hi, <br><br>
          My name is Amelie and I am 27 year old.<br>
          I have decided to start studying Javascript since I have been studying Java for 2 years now and figured it would be great to learn
          a frontend language too. I have a huge interest in IT and if I have to choose I would always prefer an iOS device over an Android device, but who knows - that might change :). <br>
          <br>
          I am originally from Stockholm but moved to Gothenburg 1 year ago and I love the accent they have here, everyone sounds so happy.
          I love travelling and have stayed in three countries except for Sweden more than 6 months. Those three are Australia, Singapore and the UK.
          If I have to answer the question which is necessary for this project I would say that I can learn anyone to swim. I just to be a professional swimmer but when
          I quite I decided to become a teacher instead and have learnt a lot of grownups and kids to swim!<br>
          <br>
          I am looking forward to know more about Javascript and getting to know you all :).<br><br>
